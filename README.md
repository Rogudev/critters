# Critters

## Description
**Critters** is an interactive application designed to allow users explore and interact with virtual creatures. The project allows users to take on the role of researchers, sharing detailed information about various creatures within the _Crittopedia_. Users have the opportunity to create their own creatures, unleashing their creativity not only by providing descriptions, types, and habitats, but also by adding images and sounds to bring their creatures to life. This interactive platform is designed for those who love to explore, create, and share their findings with other researchers and users.


## Features
- **Creature Display**: Creatures will be showcased with detailed information such as their name, description, type, habitat, and image.
- **Control Panel**: On the side, there is a control panel to create, modify, and manage your creatures.
- **Creature Actions**: Add new creatures, modify their attributes, upload images, and attach sounds to make each creature unique.


### 2. Creating Your Own Creature
To add a new creature to the _Crittopedia_, follow these steps:

1. **Fill in the Creature Information**:
   - **Name**: Give your creature a unique name.
   - **Description**: Write a detailed description of the creature's features, behavior, or backstory.
   - **Type**: Choose or define the type of your creature (e.g., mythical, alien, aquatic, etc.).
   - **Habitat**: Select the habitat or environment your creature belongs to (e.g., forest, ocean, desert, etc.).

2. **Add an Image**:
   - You can upload an image that represents your creature. This image will be displayed in the creature's profile.
   - Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`

3. **Add Sound**:
   - You can upload a sound file that plays when interacting with the creature (e.g., a roar, a chirp, or any sound that represents the creature).
   - Supported formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.ogg`

4. **Save and Share**:
   - Once your creature is created, click **Save** to store it in the _Crittopedia_. You can share it with other users or researchers, who can then explore and interact with your creature.

## 3. Interacting with Creatures
Once your creatures are saved, you can interact with them in various ways:

- **Explore Creatures**: View detailed profiles of creatures, including their name, description, type, habitat, image, and sound.
- **Search for Creatures**: Use the search bar to find specific creatures by name or type.
- **Create New Creatures**: Feel free to keep adding new creatures to the _Crittopedia_ or modify existing ones by going to the control panel and updating their details.

## 4. Customizing Your Creature
To modify an existing creature, simply navigate to its profile and click on the **Edit** button. You can update:

- The **description** and **type**.
- The **habitat** or even add a new habitat.
- **Upload a new image** or replace the existing one.
- **Change the sound** associated with the creature.

Once changes are made, click **Save** to update the creature's profile.
